# SYCL port: speedup TODO

Ordered by how little card time each one needs to test. Measured numbers live in
[docs/INTEL_PERFORMANCE.md](../docs/INTEL_PERFORMANCE.md); each item is checked with benchy v1 (`sycl/benchy.sh`) and an
output-identity comparison against the build before it.

## 1. New hardware readiness (no card time)

The B70 trains at PCIe Gen3 x8 in its current slot (it can do Gen5 x16). IQ2_XS and Swift read their ~6,000
mirrored experts over that link at every decode step, and each start reads 30-43 GB from the SSD. A second card
lets a layer split hold the IQ2_XS without a host mirror.

- [x] Multi-card path checked without a second card (2026-10-04): `setup_intel.py --check` with two simulated
      cards now sizes models across both (it used the first card only) and names the Intel path; the config keeps
      `"gpu"`/`layer_split`, the server adds `--layer-split`, `strata-sycl.sh` opens the selector to every card,
      benchy reads every card. A second card of another die needs a two-target build (`AOT=bmg-g21,bmg-g31`,
      checked to compile).
- [ ] On the new box: benchy v1 before any code change, so the hardware's share of any speedup is known.
- [ ] With the second card: a layer split of the IQ2_XS (all experts resident) through setup and benchy.

## 2. Refill lent cache slots in the background (short-prompt test)

Above 32K context the prompt path borrows VRAM cache slots and refills them from the GGUF before the first decode
round: ~1 s per request (950 ms for 1,050 slots). With served 128K/256K configs that is most of the gap between a
2,185-token prompt at 479 tok/s and the 32K config's 790.

- [x] Done another way (2026-10-04, simpler and safer than refilling during decode): the lendable experts are
      mirrored in pinned RAM at start, so the prompt path DMAs them per chunk (it read them from the GGUF) and the
      refill copies from RAM (`STRATA_LEND_MIRROR=0` turns it off). Outputs identical (Coder 2,185 / 8K / 40K,
      IQ2_XS 2,185 / 8K, cold cache). Prompt reading Coder 456 -> 610 / 802 -> 946 / 988 -> 1,046 tok/s, IQ2_XS
      303 -> 500 / 565 -> 720; refill 720-2,240 -> 200-380 ms; Coder 2,185-token TTFT 4.74 -> 3.87 s. Costs 1.9-2.3
      GiB of RAM and ~2 s at start.
- [ ] Still open: decode before the refill lands (would take the remaining ~0.3 s off TTFT).

## 3. Long prompts (parity tests + 40K-256K runs)

At 40K: expert GEMMs 23%, attention 19%, dequant 16%, QSA select 7%, host grouping 6.5%, gather 6%.

- [x] **3a. Expert grouping on the GPU: not worth it** (measured 2026-10-04). Host timers over a 40K prompt's 528
      groupings: the loops 47 ms, the uploads 24 ms, and 2,336 ms the profiler's own event fold - the "6.5%" was
      mostly the measurement. The 26 s "drain wait" is the host waiting for GPU work it had queued, not idle GPU.
- [x] **3b. QSA block selection: done** (2026-10-04). The scores as oneMKL fp32 GEMM tiles plus a relu-sum
      (`sel_scores_bench`: 7.3-8.4x the per-pair kernel at 40K-256K, relative error 2-4e-7). Coder TTFT 256K
      328.6 -> 258.2 s (780 -> 992 tok/s), 128K 138.9 -> 122.9 s, 40K 38.4 -> 37.4 s; IQ2_XS 40K 762 -> 785 tok/s.
      Not bitwise (as the CUDA build's 3xTF32 path): outputs follow the same text and part at a near-tie after 13-93
      tokens, equally coherent. `STRATA_SELECT_GEMM=0`: the old kernel.
- [ ] **3c. Prompt attention's K/V gather.** The fallback kernel (19% at 40K, ~48 s of a 256K prompt). Each query
      gathers ~2 MB of scattered K/V per layer and the kernel moves ~130 GB/s of a 608 GB/s card; its score phase
      spends 60 sub-group shuffles per cell (12 heads x a 5-step tree). Candidate: scores as thread-per-(cell, head)
      dots over K staged in local memory. Uncertain (gather-bound); the XMX versions lost twice.

## Later

- Fewer decode graph nodes (norm+rope, scores+top-k, gate+quantize fused): launch gaps are 15-20% of a round.
- Two draft branches per verify window (decode is latency-bound).
