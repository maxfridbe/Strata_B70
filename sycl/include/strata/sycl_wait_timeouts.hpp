// include/strata/sycl_wait_timeouts.hpp - the SYCL port: how many bounded device waits gave up.
//
// A device wait for a flag the host raises is bounded (kSpinMax, sycl_doorbell.hpp) because an unbounded spin that never
// sees its flag wedges the card. The price is that a wait whose flag does not arrive in time simply lets the window go on,
// with whatever the host was supposed to write still missing, and nothing says so. Each wait that gives up counts itself
// here, in host-visible memory, and the verifier reads and clears the count when the window is done.
